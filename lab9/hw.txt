ssh uses end to end encryption so anyone observing the traffic across the
network would need the associated private keys to be able to decrypt the
data being transmitted. Yes, it is reasonably secure.

	1.) It would still be secure if our keystrokes had been captured. Even if
	our passphrase had been captured the key generated could not be 
	reproduced using the passphrase since the private key is not related to
	the passphrase.

	2.) Someone being in control of the USB could compromise the security of
	our data. If the person could steal the private keys they could use them
	along with the public keys, which are publicly available, to decrypt
	our communications.

Since gpg verifies only the equality of the detached signature and the
file contents someone could reasonably change both of these if you had no
way to verify whether this was actually the correct public key. One way to
fix this issue would be to make the public key available on the webpage
associated with the software so anyone could match them to verify they
haven't been altered.
