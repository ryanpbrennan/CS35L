/u/cs/ugrad/brennans/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (RSA)

cd into .ssh directory created by keygen

ssh-copy-id brennans@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu
press yes to connect
messages says this server has been added to list of known hosts permanently
enter password to continue

eval $(ssh-agent)
Agent pid 7149

ssh-add
press enter to use default file location

ssh -X brennans@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu and enter password
-X specifies X forwarding to allow GUI interaction on the local machine

run xeyes
shows googly eyes in a small window on local machine

from any of the servers I can now simply run ssh lnxsrv07 to change to
server number 7 for instance or ssh lnxsrv09 to hop to server 8.
both times required me to enter a password.

to daisy chain ssh connections together, for instance to go through server
number 7 to get to server number 8, we can use the command
ssh -A -t brennans@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu ssh -A -t lnxsrv07 ssh -A -t lnxsrv08
I was prompted for the passphrase 3 times in a row.

alternatively we could edit the .ssh/config file and add the lines
Host brennans
	HostName brennans@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu

Host lnxsrv07
	ProxyCommand ssh -q brennans nc -q0 lnxsrv07 22

Host lnxsrv08
	ProxyCommand ssh -q lnxsrv07 nc -q0 %h 22

this would allow us to simply type ssh lnxsrv08 and only require one password
