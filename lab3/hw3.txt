Q1:
The patch would marginally improve performance by setting ignore_mode
regardless of whether it's in the default state or not, negating the need
the check the conditional statement.

Q2:
Other coreutils commands may expect the behavior of the pre-patch ls command
which would increase the likelihood of hard-to-diagnose bugs.

Q3:
randline.py fails when called on /dev/null because /dev/null will return an
EOF signal and when random.choice() is called it attempts to get the length
of that EOF signal, raising an IndexError

Q4:
when running the script with python3 instead of python2 we get a single 
syntaxError: invalid syntax as opposed to multiple tracebacks. our version 
of randline.py uses python3 syntax when raising and handling exceptions.
the line "except IOError as (errno, strerror)" tips us off to the difference.
Earlier python versions would not have used the "as" keyword.

Q5:
I used argparse as opposed to the now deprecated optparse. It seems that it 
has relatively robust backward compatability with python 2.7 because I did
not run into any issues testing my shuf.py script extensively with both
python and python3. 
python --version output 2.7.9
