1. use wget to download the coreutils-with-bug tar file

2. tar xvf coreutils-with-bug to untar package

3. cd into coreutils

4. ./configure && make
make exits with a "conflicting types" error related to a function called
futimens. it looks like there is another function called futimens that
expects different arguments

5. wget the coreutils.diff patch file

6. patch -p0 < coreutils.diff

7. make again
no errors this time. looking at the diff file it seems like some function
names were changed to avoid conflicting with previously defined functions.
specifically futimens was renamed coreutils_futimens and tee was renamed
coreutils_tee as well as some other small changes.

$ tmp=$(mktemp -d) && cd $tmp
$ touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice-cs35L
$ touch now
$ sleep 1
$ touch now1
$ TZ=UTC0 ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice-cs35L now now1
output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 brennans csugrad 0 2020-02-09 08:51:47.057214854 +0000 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 brennans csugrad 0 2020-02-09 08:51:41.052002882 +0000 now
-rw-r--r-- 1 brennans csugrad 0 1918-11-11 11:00:00.000000000 +0000 wwi-armistace-cs35L

this seems to be the correct output for the given command

9. I realized I wasn't calling the coreutils-with-bug version of ls. I ran
the same command again but specified the correct path:
~/cs35l/lab4/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt

-rw-r--r-- 1 brennans csugrad 0 1918-11-11 11:00:00.000000000 +0000 wwi-armistace-cs35L
-rw-r--r-- 1 brennans csugrad 0 2020-02-09 08:51:47.057214854 +0000 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 brennans csugrad 0 2020-02-09 08:51:41.052002882 +0000 now
which lists the oldest file as the newest.

10. I open ls.c in /src to get some idea as to where to put a breakpoint
Since I know the issue is with the -t and -l flags, I search for the word
`time` and come across a comment that describes the variable current_time as
 /* Current time in seconds and nanoseconds since 1970, updated as
    needed when deciding whether a file is recent.  */
which begins to explain one possible source of the bug.

11. being unable to find anything by searching the file, I open up gdb using
gdb ./src/ls and examine the functions in the symbol tables by typing
info functions from within gdb. Scanning the list of functions within
ls.c I see a function called sort_files and have the thought that maybe
the issue is in the sorting so I set a breakpoint at sort_files

12. run -lt --full-time wwi-armistice-cs35L now now1
stepping through after the breakpoint I find that we encounter a switch
based on the variable sort_type. examing its value using p sort_type I find
it defined as sort_time.

13. stepping through again we encounter another switch statement of the var
(time_type) which has the value time_mtime. at the next step we see the line
func = sort_reverse ? rev_cmp_mtime : compare_mtime;
where sort_reverse is false, causing the value of func to be compare_mtime
func then gets passed to qsort. it seems I need to examine compare_mtime

14. setting a breakpoint for compare_mtime and stepping through I come across
timespec_cmp (b=..., a=...) at ../lib/timespec.h:48
48    int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;
it seems like this subtraction could be causing the value to overflow and
produce the incorrect output. Knowing what I now know about qsort, I go in 
to timespec.h and change this line to a conditional that returns 1 if a is 
greater than b, -1 if a is less than b and 0 otherwise, i.e. they are equal.

15. copy coreutils/lib/timespec.h to coreutils/timespec.h and run
diff -u /lib/timespec.h timespec.h > ls.diff from within coreutils

16. change timespec.h to lib/timespec.h in ls.diff and add changelog

17. from within coreutils run patch -p0 < ls.diff

18. ./configure && make

19.
Notably, within a temporary directory the issue is solved and 
coreutils/src/ls -lt now displays the correct order but within a standard
directory the mtime of wwi-armistice-cs35L is some time in the future.
I think this is due to a difference in file systems and signed vs unsigned
integers but I'm unsure. The bug is fixed by the above modification though,
at least within the temp directory method outlined in the assignment.
